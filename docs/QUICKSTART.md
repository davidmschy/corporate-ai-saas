## Step 5: First Tasks

Start small with these beginner tasks:

### CEO Agent
- "Review our Q1 goals and suggest priorities for Q2"
- "Draft an all-hands meeting agenda"

### CFO Agent
- "Analyze last month's spending trends"
- "Create a budget forecast for next quarter"

### CMO Agent
- "Review our website copy for messaging consistency"
- "Suggest content ideas for our blog"

### CTO Agent
- "Review our current tech stack for optimization opportunities"
- "Draft a technical specification for [feature]"

## Step 6: Advanced Usage

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Delegate complex projects across multiple agents:

**Example: Product Launch**
1. CEO creates launch strategy
2. CMO develops marketing plan
3. CSO prepares sales enablement
4. CTO ensures technical readiness
5. Board reviews for risks

### Board Meetings
Schedule monthly "Board meetings" with your AI directors:
- Review financial performance (Finance Director)
- Assess cybersecurity posture (Cybersecurity Director)
- Evaluate strategic initiatives (Lead Independent Director)

### Custom Training (Scale/Enterprise)
Teach agents your company specifics:
- Upload brand guidelines
- Share previous board decks
- Provide product documentation
- Import financial historicals

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
Begin with 1-2 agents, add more as you get comfortable.

### 2. Be Specific
Good: "Analyze our Q3 marketing spend and suggest 3 cost optimizations"
Bad: "Help with marketing"

### 3. Provide Context
Share relevant documents, previous work, and constraints.

### 4. Review & Iterate
AI agents improve with feedback. Correct mistakes and explain why.

### 5. Maintain Human Oversight
AI agents recommend; humans decide. Never delegate critical decisions fully.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
- Check your API request limit
- Verify integration connections
- Check status page: status.corporateai.work

### Incorrect Responses
- Provide more context
- Correct the agent and explain
- Use custom training (Scale+)

### Integration Issues
- Re-authorize the connection
- Check API key permissions
- Contact support
